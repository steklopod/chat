# webchat ![Backend CI](https://github.com/steklopod/chat/workflows/Backend%20CI/badge.svg)

A small chat based on websockets. It supports broadcast messages and commands.
All users are stored in-memory. The chat does not allow a user if the name is already taken.

Deployed here: [HERE](http://chat-for-all.herokuapp.com/) (first entry requires more time, because Heroku starts the server)
